## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - I would suggest Square offer customers an option to stake their assets as a way to generate yield. This would             provide Square and Square’s customers an opportunity to generate a yield on the assets which otherwise would just         sit there. Square could utilize a decentralized network, such as THORChain, for staking crypto assets. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - I think this service would benefit the company in two major ways: 1) more prospective customers would find Square’s       services attractive, especially given the fact that commercial banks are offering very little interest; and, 2)           this would provide Square with an opportunity to generate more income.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - As mentioned above, this service would involve utilizing a decentralized liquidity network such as THORChain. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - These technologies are appropriate for the solution because Square prides itself as a company which offers               financial services not offered by traditional financial companies. This service would be provided through the use         of a decentralized network, which further enables customers to have easier access to capital.
